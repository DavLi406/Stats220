## What's going on with this data?

This report explores how people's budgeting habits may relate to how satisfied they are with their spending. It also looks at common spending categories and income levels.

## Summary statistics

```{r summary, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
csv_url <- "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRp68OJG1BppqOKpFNqu4lZ6M_Mei5fYUkEFATFg9_d9waPKM_cOAVodqgoxHJonBNl3a6-xxLA36uF/pub?gid=352280045&single=true&output=csv"
logged_data <- read_csv(csv_url)
latest_data <- logged_data %>%
  rename(avg_monthly_expenditure = `What is your average monthly expenditure in NZD (4 weeks)?`,
    largest_spending_category = `Which category accounts for the largest portion of your monthly spending?`,
    monthly_budget = `Do you maintain a monthly budget for your expenses? (Yes -> 1, No -> 2, Sometimes -> 3)`,
    avg_monthly_income = `What is your average monthly income in NZD? (4 weeks)`,
    spending_habits_satisfaction = `How satisfied are you with your current spending habits?`
  ) %>%
  select(-Timestamp)
# Group 1: No budget
no_plan_group <- latest_data %>%
  select(monthly_budget, spending_habits_satisfaction) %>%
  filter(monthly_budget == 2) %>%
  pull(spending_habits_satisfaction)
num_no_plan <- length(no_plan_group)
print(num_no_plan)
mean_score_no <- mean(no_plan_group, na.rm = TRUE)
print(mean_score_no)

# Group 2: Sometimes budget
sometimes_plan_group <- latest_data %>%
  select(monthly_budget, spending_habits_satisfaction) %>%
  filter(monthly_budget == 3) %>%
  pull(spending_habits_satisfaction)
num_sometimes_plan <- length(sometimes_plan_group)
print(num_sometimes_plan)
mean_score_sometimes <- mean(sometimes_plan_group, na.rm = TRUE)
print(mean_score_sometimes)

# Group 3: Always budget
planed_group <- latest_data %>%
  select(monthly_budget, spending_habits_satisfaction) %>%
  filter(monthly_budget == 1) %>%
  pull(spending_habits_satisfaction)
num_plan <- length(planed_group)
print(num_plan)
mean_score_plan <- mean(planed_group, na.rm = TRUE)
print(mean_score_plan)
```

### Dynamic comment

-   People who always have a budget trend to be more satisfy to their spending.

## Bar Chart 1: Spending category by income

```{r bar1, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = latest_data) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = factor(largest_spending_category), fill = factor(avg_monthly_income)))
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Bar Chart 2: Satisfaction score by budgeting habit

```{r bar2, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = latest_data) + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = factor(spending_habits_satisfaction), fill = factor(monthly_budget))) + 
  labs(
    title = "Spending Habits Satisfaction",
    x = "Score",
    y = "Number ppl"
  )
```

```{r}
pets <- c("cat", "dog", "turtle", "rabbit")
best_pet <- pets[1]

```

The best pet to have is a `r best_pet` of course!
